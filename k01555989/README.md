KAPRUN is located in SalzburgerLand in Austria, home to around 3,000 permanent residents and almost 1,000 owners of second homes. The more than 770,000 annual overnights attest to this community's importance for tourism. There is much to experience in the Zell am See - KAPRUN region. Kaprun offers numerous special events and a wide variety of sporting and recreational opportunities.
The name KAPRUN encompasses the Kitzsteinhorn - Salzburg's only glacier ski area at an elevation of 3,203 m and Summit World 3000, Salzburg's highest lookout platform - easily reachable by lift.
The Maiskogel, too, is a popular excursion destination in summer, as well as a vibrant ski area in winter.
For fans of wellness there is TAUERN SPA Zell am See - KAPRUN. At one of the most modern wellness attractions anywhere in the Alps, 11 in- and outdoor pools invite guests to discover total relaxation. Aside from the sauna area with 10 different saunas and steam baths, the treatment facilities are also beyond compare.
Kaprun also became famous for its hydroelectric power plants. The imposing high-mountain reservoirs at around 2,000 m above sea level are a popular attraction for visitors. Skiing (also in summer on the glacier), golf, mountain biking, swimming, hiking, relaxation, and much more, all represent very special experiences in the Zell am See - Kaprun region.
